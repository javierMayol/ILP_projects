Assignment: Calculator
	This JavaScript/HTML project implements a simple calculator that can be
	used to do simple math. I attempt to keep the code simple by decoupling style routines
	to the file 'calculatorStyle.css', so I can include graphics in CSS and keep the project organized.
	Separating the JavaScript code from the HTML is pending. Please refer to the
	below section "Problems" for a description.
	
Problems:
	When trying to link the JavaScrip file 'calculate.js' to the HTML file 'calculator.html'
	the functionality of the calculator stopped and I couldn't find the reason after debbuging.
	I resolved this by including a <script> tag inside the html with all the variable functions.
	
	The linkage of the 'calculator.js' file would only allowed the function expression to work 
	whenever this method was the only element included in the file. Other methods created some
	kind of conflict that I still cannot understand.
	
Supported by the calculator:
	*	Simple math operations like sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.
	
	*	The user is allowed to declare a variable at start of the calculation by typing
		a letter from the keyboard and typing the equal sing (=). Then, all operations can be 
		executed with the buttons in the screen.
	
	*	If a letter that is not a variable is entered, the calculator screen is cleared and 
		the expression is lost but the user can input another expression.
	
	*	Division by zero error is handle and a popup will come if a dicision by zero is attempted.
